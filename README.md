# VBA - The VBA of Wall Street


* This repo contains homework from the Excel-VBA lecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.
* I used Excel VBA to analyze stock data across multiple worksheets.
* There is a Macro Script that loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and takes the following information:
	* The ticker symbol.
	* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	* The total stock volume of the stock.
* In addition, there is a conditional formatting that highlights the positive change in green and negative change in red.
* A screen shot for each year of my results has been provided.
